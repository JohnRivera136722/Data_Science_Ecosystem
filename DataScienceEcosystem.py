# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
# 
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# __Objectives:__
# - Throughout this notebook commonly used programming languages in the Data Science world will shown
# - Popular libraries utilized by Data Scientist are seen
# - A list of Tools that are commonly used in the Data Science world will be displayed

# Some of the most popular languages that Data Scientist use are:
# 1. Python
# 1. R
# 1. SQL
# 
# 

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

# In[1]:


a = (3*4)+5
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
print(a)


# In[4]:


min_hr = 200/60
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
print(min_hr,'hours')
